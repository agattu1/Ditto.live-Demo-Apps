# Ditto.live-Demo-Apps
Ditto is cloud computing company which does sync w/o internet. They prioritize peer to peer networking rather than having and pulling from a cloud base. I built out a CUSTOM CRM for Ditto + Andriod App Search Toggle Feature (including a total price point with color adjustment) for their Inventory app.
