I had to build a CUSTOM CRM for Ditto + Andriod App.
The Custom CRM (customer relationship management) tool was build using the MAMP (Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP—a pre-packaged local server environment for macOS (though there’s also MAMP Pro for advanced users and Windows versions). It’s like a "one-click" way to run a PHP/MySQL server on your computer without complex setup.)
and LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) Architecture.

Unlike Java or .NET, PHP doesn’t require complex setup—just a server (like MAMP/XAMPP) and a text editor.
