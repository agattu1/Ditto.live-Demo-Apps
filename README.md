### Ditto Custom CRM
I had to build a CUSTOM CRM for Ditto + Andriod App.
The Custom CRM (customer relationship management) tool was build using the MAMP (Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP‚Äîa pre-packaged local server environment for macOS (though there‚Äôs also MAMP Pro for advanced users and Windows versions). It‚Äôs like a "one-click" way to run a PHP/MySQL server on your computer without complex setup.)
and LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) Architecture.

Unlike Java or .NET, PHP (which was build as a helper brother to MySQL) doesn‚Äôt require complex setup‚Äîjust a server (like MAMP/XAMPP) and a text editor.

> PHP is a server-side language‚Äîit can‚Äôt run in a browser like JavaScript.

When you visit a .php file (e.g., index.php), here‚Äôs what happens:

1. Apache receives the request.

2. Apache hands the PHP file to the PHP interpreter (installed in MAMP).

3. PHP runs, talks to MySQL/MongoDB/PostgreSQL if needed.

4. Apache sends back the final HTML to your browser.

> Without Apache (or an alternative like Nginx), PHP files wouldn‚Äôt execute‚Äîthey‚Äôd just download as text!
But the thing is, Nginx is more efficeint for high traffic apps. Using Node.js/Python/Ruby ‚Üí They have their own servers (Express, Django, Rails)

Apache is the "bridge" between your browser and PHP/MySQL.
MAMP bundles Apache so you don‚Äôt have to install/config it manually.

1. Once MySQL & MAMP is downloaded add the `CRM-System-WebApp-master` AND `index.php` files into **htdocs** folder
2. Configure MAMP & MySQL
3. When editing the MySQL DB, go to the database folder, open the `install` SQL Text File, edit the content, copy/paste it into Query 1 after opening the MySQL Workbench Connections, select ALL & hit ‚ö°
4.

### **Key Characteristics of Your Custom CRM**
Based on your code and database structure, your CRM appears to be designed better than off the shelf CRM b/c it is tailored software solution designed specifically to manage Ditto organization's interactions w current & potential customers!

1. **Sales Pipeline Management**
   - Tracks leads, opportunities, and won customers
   - Manures tasks and notes for sales reps
   - 
2. **Contact Management**
   - Stores detailed contact info (names, emails, companies)
   - Tracks communication history (notes table)
   - Manures referral sources and background info

3. **User Roles & Permissions**
   - Distinguishes between sales reps, managers, and admins
   - Controls access to features (e.g., only managers see "Customers/Won")


Not fully synced with the ditto.live experience just yet but I was planning to knock that out b4 I came across doing DemoApp

Small Peer setup is completed (embedded local-first database w/o the Ditto SDK)
No JSON DB , I provide a SYSTEMATIC Schema upfront w MySQL!

custom CRM allows:

Searching Pillsbury ‚Üí Finds Linda DeCastro

Viewing her record ‚Üí Shows project details

Checking linked notes ‚Üí Reveals call history!





































































   

### Andriod App

I first played around with the [Inventory demo app](https://github.com/getditto/demoapp-inventory) from Ditto which showed me Ditto real-time sync via peer to peer devices in the mesh of food inventory counter. I had to initalize my App ID and Auth URL from the Ditto Portal to connect via SDK (I called it [outreachable](https://portal.ditto.live/app/outreachable/connect)).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/122d50b4-af2e-4e79-b22e-cf7ddd022ec3)

I listed the creds in the `secure/debug_creds.properties` file so Android looks at that .env file. When gradle restores packages, it should auto load in the information from the .env file to the BuildConfig. DittoManager then reads these values and uses them to connect to Ditto.

For more information, see the [build.gradle](https://github.com/getditto/demoapp-inventory/blob/main/Android/app/build.gradle#L20) file.

Here is a systematic and chronological breakdown of the key changes made to enable working search functionality in the Ditto Inventory demo app:

Here is a **systematic and chronological breakdown** of the key changes made to enable working search functionality in the Ditto Inventory demo app:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Manifest Configuration**

**File:** `AndroidManifest.xml`

* **Added** the `SearchActivity`:

  ```xml
  <activity android:name="live.ditto.inventory.SearchActivity"/>
  ```
* **Ensured Permissions**:

  * Bluetooth, location, internet, and network-related permissions were declared, which are needed for Ditto syncing.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **UI Layout for Search**

**File:** `item_search_result.xml` (name inferred from adapter)

* **Defined** the layout of each search result item, including:

  * `ImageView` for product image.
  * `TextView` for title, detail, and count.
  * Used `ConstraintLayout` for responsiveness.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Created `SearchActivity.kt`**

**File:** `SearchActivity.kt`

* **Functionality:**

  * Initializes RecyclerView and adapter (`SearchAdapter`).
  * Adds a debounced `TextWatcher` to input field.
  * On every text change:

    * Closes previous `DittoStoreObserver`.
    * Initiates a new observer via `DittoManager.observeSearchResults()`.
  * Converts matched documents to `ItemModel` and submits to adapter.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Created `SearchAdapter.kt`**

**File:** `SearchAdapter.kt`

* **Purpose:**

  * Displays search result items using a custom layout.
  * Supports click listener (optional).
  * Efficient updates using `DiffUtil`.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Major Overhaul in `DittoManager.kt`**

**File:** `DittoManager.kt`

* ‚úÖ **Refactored `observeSearchResults()`**:

  * **Old issue:** You initially used `".contains($0)"`, which caused runtime `ParseError`.
  * **Fix:** Changed to proper DQL `LIKE` usage:

    ```kotlin
    val query = """
        SELECT * 
        FROM inventories 
        WHERE title LIKE :query OR detail LIKE :query
    """
    val params = mapOf("query" to "%$queryText%")
    ```
  * **Returns:** `DittoStoreObserver` instead of `CombinedLiveQuery`.
  * **Handles Result Conversion:** Converts each result to a `DittoDocument` using `_id` lookup and maps to corresponding `ItemModel`.
 
  * **COLLECTIONS**
  * Ditto stores data records as documents (JSON-like) which are gathered together in collections.
  *  An application stores one or more collection of documents ( All DOCS are in Collections)  Internally these documents are CRDTs, which are a binary representation of JSON doc
  *  Query Collections : DATABASE INTERACTIONS OCCUR W/ COLLECTIONS NOT DOCS!


* ‚úÖ **Logging:** Added logs for debugging Ditto startup, data loading, and search events.

* ‚úÖ **Improved Defensive Checks:** Early return if Ditto is uninitialized.

* ‚úÖ **Removed Invalid References:**

  * Removed incorrect usage of `DittoObserver` and `findByID` which do not exist in Ditto SDK.
 
  * public final class DittoStore
Provides access to execute Ditto queries, work with DittoCollections and a write transaction API

-> 
public final class DittoStoreObserver
    : Closeable
A store observer invokes an observation handler whenever results for its query change.
Create a store observer by calling DittoStore.registerObserver. The store observer will remain active until the owning Ditto instance goes out of scope or the DittoStoreObserver.close is called


---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Hooked Search Button in MainActivity**

**File:** `MainActivity.kt`

* **Method Added**:

  ```kotlin
  fun openSearchScreen(view: View) {
      startActivity(Intent(this, SearchActivity::class.java))
  }
  ```
* **Ensure Button in Layout**:

  * Search icon or button in XML must be set to `onClick="openSearchScreen"`.

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **Visual Enhancements**

* ‚ú≥Ô∏è **UI Detail Improvements** in `itemsForView`:

  * Emojis and polished descriptions (e.g., `"Cold can of Coke üßä"`).
* ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Live Count Sync:** Updates UI with real-time count changes.

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **Live Filtering Logic**

* **In Adapter:**

  * Filters results based on `_id` and dynamically updates counts.
* **Thread-Safe Execution:**

  * UI updates use `runOnUiThread`.

---

### ‚úÖ 9. **Closing Observers**

* **In `onDestroy()` of `SearchActivity`:**

  ```kotlin
  override fun onDestroy() {
      searchObserver?.close()
      super.onDestroy()
  }
  ```

## Future work...

If I could euphoria a new model for the inventory api for scaling when we have tons of food inventory added into stock and nearby locations which offer that inventory food item specifically. 

Access pattern which you might see:

When the front end service wants to get all of the restaurants nearby with their food inventory to show it to the user, we are going to make it call the list resturants api & return all the resturants we have 

This could break tho x....x What if we have 10 GB data of resturants in the DB?
Aws Lambda caps out at 6 MB ... if more resturants it will break

`Solution` : Pagination

When the front end wants restaurants, We're just gonna return their list up the 10 nearest restaurants plus a token they can use to make a second API call to get the 10 restaurants after that.
Users wont care as they may only want to look at the inventory in the 10 nearest resturants anyway... (Its like 2nd pg of Google)
